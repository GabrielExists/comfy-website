We have been building Comfy internally at [LogLog Games](https://loglog.games/)
almost a year now. As such, we have a few games that are using it.

The two bigger examples are

- [NANOVOID](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2326430/NANOVOID/)
- [BITGUN Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081500/BITGUN_Survivors)

We also have a small unconventional example of using comfy to do 2D CPU based
raytracing
[https://logloggames.itch.io/bitmob-1-bit-jam](https://logloggames.itch.io/bitmob-1-bit-jam),
which will be opensourced soon. It's a relatively small game, but hopefully
will serve as a nice illustration of non-conventional ways to make games.
Specifically, the whole game is a single texture where every pixel is copied
over from other textures, and lighting calculated using simple raytracing.
