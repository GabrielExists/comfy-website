Comfy is still very early in its lifecycle. While it has been used to make
games, only a few people have used it or even seen the source code so far.
The best way to contribute is to use comfy and report any issues you find.

The codebase is not clean by any means. It is not the goal of comfy to be the
most beautiful codebase out there. Many things may be suboptimal, and for some
of them it makes a lot of sense to have an open discussion about it. But pull
requests which just reformat the code or move things around or do some kind of
re-organization will likely be rejected unless there was a prior discussion.

If you find anything that does not work as expected please do open an issue.
Comfy is meant to be a productive and ergonomic companion for those who want to
make games.

If something is not ergonomic or you have an idea for how it could be more ergonomic
without sacrificing too much, please open an issue.

If you really just want to make a pull request to contribute _something_
without a prior discussion, the best place are the examples. Both simple and
advanced examples, as well as small example games, are welcome.

Comfy is not currently aiming for heavy documentation coverage due to the rapid
pace of development. Examples are preferred to documentation as they're easier
to fix when APIs change. Most things should be self-explanatory.
